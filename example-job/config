# CRONSH_READ_CONFIG
# used internally

# CRONSH_JOBDIR
# directory where the invoked cronsh job lives with its configs, logs, code, data and control files
# its value comes from positional argument, not from config. it's also has been already acquired when config file is being processed
# don't use it
