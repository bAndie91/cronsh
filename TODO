cronshctl ps --start-time --end-time

cronshctl vars <JOBDIR>

allow delete an instance's work dir (which did nothing valuable)

keep time (timeout and deadline) in precondition check phase as well

cronsh: run detached in background

expose more variables for hook scripts (CRONSH_PRECHECK_INTERVAL, CRONSH_ATTEMPTS_INTERVAL, CRONSH_ATTEMPTS_DEADLINE_DATESTR ...) and recalculate them

account for changing CRONSH_INSTANCE_CANONICAL_DIR_TEMPLATE
