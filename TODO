expose more variables for hook scripts (CRONSH_PRECHECK_INTERVAL, CRONSH_ATTEMPTS_INTERVAL, CRONSH_ATTEMPTS_DEADLINE_DATESTR ...)
and recalculate them (cronsh_apply_vars())

allow job parameters

cronshctl ps --start-time --end-time

cronshctl vars <JOBDIR>

allow delete an instance's work dir (which did nothing valuable)

keep time (timeout and deadline) in precondition check phase as well

cronsh: run detached in background (even w/o keept)

account for changing CRONSH_INSTANCE_CANONICAL_DIR_TEMPLATE

debugger:
	- listen to input and run them in the main scope
